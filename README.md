# metagame

This is based on the original from https://github.com/Blinkity/metagame. However, it is old with very old versions, that don't really work anymore.
I made some changes:

* usable with python 3.8 and most up2date package versions
* corrected function calls and parameter for the newest package versions
* added a requirements text with explicit version for easy install
* added the option to parse multiple matchup.csv
* still no cli or gui 

I hope this is helpful. It has lots of examples! (aka trail&error).

USE Fighting_games_bounds.py for individual files or GetAllGameDataBound.py for a list of matchupcharts.

sfvmatchupdata_2021.py has additional requirements, that are written in the file in the subfolder.
